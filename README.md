Midsem demo on 4th November

To do: Ist page - two buttons - create poll and join poll
Once you click on create poll, display the poll title and the question. This is to be done in the form of a form. There should be a submit button, which goes to a new page which is dynamically counting the results. On the same page, there should be a button to exit the poll. There should also be a back to main menu button. 

Once you click on join poll, it displays the list of polls that exist in that particular network. There should be a bunch of radio buttons, and a join button (this maybe changed later on). Title will be displayed along with the questions. Every question has a corresponding field, along with a submit buton.
